# customer churn prediction

The customer churn prediction system uses machine learning and works on the basis that it predicts whether a customer is at a high risk of leaving a company or cancelling a certain package or service. A number of variables include age, tenure, dependants, monthly charges and total charges. Through these variables, the system predicts which customer is bound to churn.
